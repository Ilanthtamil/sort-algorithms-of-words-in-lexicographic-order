# sort-algorithms-of-words-in-lexicographic-order

Implement the assignment in Java. The program is required to implement insertion, bubble, quick and radix sort algorithms on a list of words in lexicographic order. Add a counter in appropriate location of your implementation to count the number of times primitive operations. Run the program using experimental English dataset given and try to find and run the worst case, average case, and best case.
